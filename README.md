# 6502-lcd-4bit

This project is based on Ben Eaters 65C02 kit, and carries on from video #4 which is the completed "hello world" program.  From that point this project describes the changes in hardware and software required to operate the LCD in "4-bit mode" allowing for its contorl using only 1 port of the 65C22  (3 control bits, 4 data bits, 1 unused).

#Hardware:
The pin rewiring is documneted at the top of the code

#Software:
The assembly code is profusly commented, largely to remind me what I did.
The delay functions are detailed in the spreadsheet with the reference to the original creators, the formula's used, and the spreadsheet is set up to calculate the delay that I needed.
